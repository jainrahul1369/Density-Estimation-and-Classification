MNIST dataset contains 14118 images of ‘7’ and ‘8’. We need to train a model to identify
the images of test dataset using both Naive bayes algorithm and Logistic Regression.
Mean and standard deviation is considered to be the 2 features of each image. Once the
model is trained, it will be tested against testing dataset and will try to find the accuracy
of the model.
Report will demonstrate step by step procedure of creating and training the model using
Naive Bayes Algorithm as well as Logistic Regression.
